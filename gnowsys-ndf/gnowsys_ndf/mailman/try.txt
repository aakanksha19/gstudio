I could give it a try if there are no other takers. I'd have to learn, but
I'm doing PR for one of my Toastmasters clubs now, so I need to learn
anyway.

Hi,

I was just getting ready to post a job posting to the BayPiggies list when
I realized that the policy link on the mailing list page, as viewed at:

https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/baypiggies


includes an extraneous index_html segment:

http://baypiggies.net/index_html/job-listings


It seems like the right link is:

http://baypiggies.net/job-listings


Thanks much!

Cool! Are you free to meet sometime over the next couple weeks in Mountain
View, and do you have a laptop you can use for this? I can show you how to
setup a Hangout and start a broadcast.

Hi all,

I work as the backend engineer for an offshoot of Will Wright's Stupid Fun
Club in Berkeley, and I'm looking for a second backend engineer.

Details can be found here:

http://stupidfunclub.com/jobs.html


So far as numbers go, our business is just over a dozen employees right
now, with a consumer beta starting near summer's end. The two frontends are
implemented against WebGL & iOS. All of our backend and operations
automation is in Python.

If you're interested or have any questions, please feel free to write me at
hunter at napofearth.com.

Subject: [baypiggies] Saturday Python Class and more
Message-ID: <CAMDjdqwRdvTdzjzu10-=Ze-1Cx_G6XXphRNO5Onka_wcn-XJkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Python People,

We are starting a Saturday Python class for programmers (experienced in
any other language) at UCSC-Extension Silicon Valley's labs in Santa
Clara, right across 101 from the Great America sign.
http://course.ucsc-extension.edu/modules/shop/index.html?action=section&OfferingID=1531625&SectionID=5275735

It will be 5 Saturdays and give students experience in all core concepts of
Python.

The course is low-pressure, but fast-paced, where students learn and
practice core concepts and Pythonic thinking.  To join this class, you
should be well-practiced at programming in some other language.

No beginning programmers please, but you can certainly be new to Python.
If you are beginner, please find your class below under "NOVICES".

ONLINE CLASS:

If you would prefer an online class, you will enjoy:
http://course.ucsc-extension.edu/modules/shop/index.html?action=section&OfferingID=1531625&SectionID=5274871

The online site for this course is open now and new enrollments will be
accepted until July 15.

If you would prefer more time with the online materials, and with me and
our online assistant instructor, Casey The, then you might like to wait and
join the class that opens August 5:
http://course.ucsc-extension.edu/modules/shop/index.html?action=section&OfferingID=1531625&SectionID=5274872

FOR NOVICES

For 6 Thursday evenings, starting July 10, we will hold the "Introduction
To Programming For Beginners, Using Python" class which prepares
programming novices to take the Python For Programmers' class:
http://course.ucsc-extension.edu/modules/shop/index.html?action=section&OfferingID=3576274&SectionID=5274926

which is 6 nights of acquiring basic programming skills in python and
prepares you for the next programmers class

If you have programming experience in any language skip the Beginners
class listed above and join a Programmers' class.

----
All our Python courses are hands-on with short lectures, and lots of
exercises where we study the solutions after some lab time.

Questions are always welcome; discussion and pair-programming are encouraged.

Please come, and send students!

---

And, the first quarter of the professional course is available for $20 at
Udemy.Com!  I'm so busy that I can't say when the rest of the course will
be there, but I'm working on it.
https://www.udemy.com/pythonic-python-part-i-the-basics/

I hope you find one of these classes useful to your schedule and your taste.
